## Understanding Dunbar's Number

### What is Dunbar's Number?

Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. British anthropologist Robin Dunbar proposed that humans can comfortably maintain:

- **5 people** - Your closest loved ones (Inner Circle)
- **15 people** - Good friends you see regularly (Close Friends)
- **50 people** - Friends you see occasionally (Active Friends)
- **150 people** - Meaningful contacts (Casual Network)
- **500+ people** - Acquaintances you recognize (Acquaintances)

### Why Does This Matter?

Understanding these natural relationship tiers helps you:
- **Prioritize** your time and energy appropriately
- **Maintain** meaningful connections without feeling overwhelmed
- **Identify** relationships that need attention
- **Balance** your social network for optimal well-being

CatchUp uses these circles to help you organize contacts and provide intelligent suggestions for staying in touch.

## Getting Started

### When Does Onboarding Start?

Onboarding begins automatically in three scenarios:

1. **New User** - When you first create your CatchUp account with no contacts
2. **After Import** - When you connect Google Contacts or import contacts from another source
3. **Manual Management** - When you click the "Manage" button on your Contacts page

### The Onboarding Flow

The onboarding process consists of several steps:

1. **Welcome** - Introduction to the feature and Dunbar's number
2. **Import Contacts** (if needed) - Connect Google Contacts or add manually
3. **Circle Assignment** - Organize contacts into your five circles
4. **Preference Setting** - Set contact frequency for your closest circles
5. **Completion** - Review your network and celebrate!

You can exit at any time and resume later - your progress is automatically saved.

## Organizing Your Contacts

### The Circular Visualization

When you enter the onboarding interface, you'll see a beautiful circular visualization with five concentric rings representing your social circles.

**Understanding the Visualization:**
- **Innermost ring** - Inner Circle (smallest, most important)
- **Second ring** - Close Friends
- **Third ring** - Active Friends
- **Fourth ring** - Casual Network
- **Outermost ring** - Acquaintances (largest)

Each contact appears as a colored dot with their initials inside the appropriate circle.

### Drag-and-Drop Organization

**To assign a contact to a circle:**

1. **Click and hold** on a contact dot
2. **Drag** the contact toward the desired circle
3. The target circle will **highlight** as you hover over it
4. **Release** to drop the contact into the new circle
5. The contact is **immediately saved** to that circle

**Tips:**
- You can drag contacts between any circles
- Hover over a contact to see their full name
- The visualization updates in real-time
- Changes are saved automatically

### Batch Operations

**To move multiple contacts at once:**

1. **Select multiple contacts** by clicking them (they'll highlight)
2. **Drag any selected contact** to the target circle
3. **All selected contacts** move together
4. Confirm the batch operation

This is especially useful when organizing many contacts from an import.

### Circle Capacity Indicators

Each circle shows:
- **Current count** - How many contacts are in the circle
- **Recommended size** - The ideal number based on Dunbar's research
- **Status indicator** - Visual feedback (green = optimal, yellow = over capacity)

**Don't worry about going over!** These are recommendations, not hard limits. Everyone's social network is unique.

## AI-Powered Suggestions

### How AI Suggestions Work

CatchUp analyzes your interaction patterns to suggest the most appropriate circle for each contact. The AI considers:

- **Communication frequency** - How often you interact
- **Recency** - When you last communicated
- **Consistency** - Regular vs. sporadic contact
- **Calendar events** - Meetings and shared activities
- **Response time** - How quickly you respond to each other
- **Multi-channel** - Communication across email, calls, messages

### Understanding Confidence Scores

Each AI suggestion includes a confidence score:

- **90-100%** - Very confident (pre-selected for one-click acceptance)
- **70-89%** - Confident (suggested but easy to override)
- **50-69%** - Moderate confidence (multiple options shown)
- **Below 50%** - Low confidence (manual selection recommended)

### Accepting or Overriding Suggestions

**To accept an AI suggestion:**
- Simply click the **"Accept"** button next to the suggested circle
- The contact is immediately assigned

**To override a suggestion:**
- Drag the contact to a different circle, or
- Click a different circle option if multiple are shown
- The AI learns from your choice for future suggestions

### Teaching the AI

The more you use CatchUp, the better the AI becomes at understanding your relationship patterns. When you override suggestions, the system:

- Records your preference
- Analyzes why you made that choice
- Adjusts future suggestions for similar contacts
- Improves accuracy over time

## Tips & Best Practices

### Getting Started

✅ **Start with your closest relationships** - Assign your Inner Circle first
✅ **Trust the AI suggestions** - They're based on real interaction data
✅ **Don't overthink it** - You can always adjust circles later
✅ **Use Weekly Catchup** - Break the task into manageable chunks
✅ **Set realistic preferences** - Be honest about how often you can stay in touch

### Maintaining Your Network

✅ **Review quarterly** - Relationships evolve, so update circles periodically

✅ **Archive inactive contacts** - Keep your active network focused
✅ **Update preferences** - Adjust contact frequencies as life changes
✅ **Celebrate milestones** - Acknowledge your progress in maintaining relationships

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't put everyone in Inner Circle** - This defeats the purpose of prioritization
❌ **Don't ignore capacity indicators** - They're based on cognitive research
❌ **Don't skip preference setting** - It helps CatchUp provide better suggestions
❌ **Don't feel guilty** - Not everyone can be in your closest circles
❌ **Don't rush** - Take time to thoughtfully categorize relationships

### Dealing with Difficult Decisions

**"I have more than 5 people I'm very close to"**
- Consider if some belong in Close Friends instead
- Remember: Inner Circle is for daily/near-daily contact
- Quality over quantity in the innermost circle

**"I don't know which circle someone belongs in"**
- Ask: How often do we actually communicate?
- Consider: How much effort does this relationship require?
- Trust your gut: Where does it feel right?

**"Someone might be offended if they knew their circle"**
- Remember: Circle assignments are completely private
- This is for your benefit, not a judgment of others
- Different relationships serve different purposes

**"My circles don't match the recommended sizes"**
- That's okay! Everyone's network is unique
- Recommendations are guidelines, not rules
- Focus on what works for your life
