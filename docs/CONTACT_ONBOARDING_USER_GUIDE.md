# Contact Onboarding User Guide

Welcome to CatchUp's Contact Onboarding! This guide will help you get started with organizing your relationships into meaningful circles based on research-backed principles.

## Overview

The Contact Onboarding feature provides a streamlined 3-step guided experience to help you:

1. **Connect your integrations** (Google Calendar & Contacts)
2. **Organize contacts into circles** based on relationship depth
3. **Review group mapping suggestions** to sync your existing groups

This process is designed to be flexible - you can complete it all at once, or come back to it anytime.

## The Science Behind Circles

### Dunbar's Number

British anthropologist Robin Dunbar discovered that humans can maintain stable social relationships with approximately 150 people. His research identified distinct layers within this network:

- **5 people**: Closest confidants (support clique)
- **15 people**: Good friends (sympathy group)
- **50 people**: Friends (band)
- **150 people**: Meaningful contacts (tribe)

### Simplified 4-Circle System

CatchUp uses a simplified version with 4 circles to reduce cognitive load while maintaining the research-backed structure:

#### Inner Circle (up to 10 people)
Your closest confidants - people you'd call in a crisis. These relationships are built on deep trust, mutual respect, and shared values.

**Aristotle's Perspective**: These are "virtue-based friendships" - the highest form of friendship based on mutual admiration of each other's character.

**Examples**:
- Your partner or spouse
- Your best friend since childhood
- Family members you're extremely close to
- The person you call when something major happens

#### Close Friends (up to 25 people)
Good friends you regularly share life updates with. You make time for these relationships and genuinely care about their wellbeing.

**Aristotle's Perspective**: Mix of virtue and "pleasure-based friendships" - people you enjoy spending time with and who enrich your life.

**Examples**:
- College roommates you still talk to regularly
- Coworkers who became real friends
- Friends you make plans with monthly
- People you'd invite to important life events

#### Active Friends (up to 50 people)
People you want to stay connected with regularly. You enjoy their company and share activities or interests.

**Aristotle's Perspective**: Often "pleasure-based friendships" centered around shared activities, hobbies, or contexts.

**Examples**:
- Running club members you chat with
- Friends from a hobby group
- Former coworkers you grab coffee with occasionally
- Friends you see at social gatherings

#### Casual Network (up to 100 people)
Acquaintances you keep in touch with occasionally. These are valuable connections but don't require frequent interaction.

**Aristotle's Perspective**: Often "utility-based friendships" - professional contacts or contextual relationships that are mutually beneficial.

**Examples**:
- Professional contacts and colleagues
- Neighbors you're friendly with
- Parents from your kids' school
- People you met at conferences

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Integrations

The first step is connecting your Google Calendar and Google Contacts so CatchUp can help you maintain relationships.

**What you'll do**:
1. Click on "Step 1: Connect Accounts" in the onboarding indicator
2. You'll be taken to the Preferences page
3. Connect your Google Calendar (for availability and meeting history)
4. Connect your Google Contacts (to import your contact list)

**Why this matters**:
- Calendar integration helps CatchUp understand when you're available
- Contact integration brings in your existing relationships
- Both enable AI-powered suggestions based on your interaction patterns

**Privacy note**: CatchUp uses read-only access and never shares your data with third parties. See our privacy policy for details.

### Step 2: Organize Your Circles

Once your integrations are connected, you'll organize your contacts into the 4 circles.

**What you'll do**:
1. Click on "Step 2: Organize Circles" in the onboarding indicator
2. The Manage Circles flow will open automatically
3. Review the educational tips about Dunbar's research
4. Use the search bar to find specific contacts
5. Assign each contact to a circle using the dropdown
6. Review AI suggestions (when available) for quick categorization
7. Track your progress as you go

**Tips for success**:
- **Start with your Inner Circle**: Think about who you'd call in an emergency
- **Don't overthink it**: Your first instinct is usually right
- **Use AI suggestions**: The system analyzes your communication patterns to help
- **It's flexible**: You can always change assignments later
- **Take breaks**: You don't have to categorize everyone at once

**Understanding AI suggestions**:
The system analyzes:
- Communication frequency (how often you interact)
- Recency (when you last connected)
- Calendar co-attendance (shared meetings/events)

High-confidence suggestions (80%+) are pre-selected for one-click acceptance.

**Progress tracking**:
- You'll see a progress bar showing how many contacts you've categorized
- Circle capacity indicators show how many people are in each circle
- You'll get encouraging messages at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%

**Capacity warnings**:
If a circle exceeds its recommended capacity, you'll see a gentle warning. This is just a suggestion - you can still add more people if it makes sense for your network.

### Step 3: Review Group Mappings

If you have existing Google Contact groups, CatchUp will suggest how to map them to your new circles.

**What you'll do**:
1. Click on "Step 3: Review Groups" in the onboarding indicator
2. Review AI-generated mapping suggestions
3. Accept mappings that make sense
4. Skip or modify mappings that don't fit
5. Complete the onboarding when all mappings are reviewed

**Understanding confidence scores**:
- **High (80%+)**: Strong match based on group names and member overlap
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Reasonable match but may need review
- **Low (<60%)**: Uncertain match - review carefully

**What happens to your groups**:
- Accepted mappings will sync members to the suggested CatchUp groups
- Skipped mappings won't affect your contacts
- You can always manage groups manually later

## After Onboarding

### Accessing Manage Circles Anytime

You can update your circle assignments anytime:

1. Go to the Directory page
2. Click on the "Circles" tab
3. Click the "Manage Circles" button
4. Make your changes and save

### Resuming Incomplete Onboarding

If you dismissed the onboarding:

1. Look for the "Resume Onboarding" button in the sidebar
2. Click it to continue where you left off
3. Your progress is automatically saved

### Updating Your Circles

Relationships evolve! Update your circles as:
- Friendships deepen (move someone to a closer circle)
- Life changes (someone moves away, you change jobs)
- You reconnect with old friends
- You make new connections

## Best Practices

### For Inner Circle
- Keep this small and intentional
- These are your "call at 3am" people
- Quality over quantity

### For Close Friends
- Aim for regular contact (monthly or more)
- These are people you actively maintain relationships with
- Include people you genuinely care about, not just frequent contacts

### For Active Friends
- People you want to stay connected with
- May see less frequently but still value the relationship
- Shared interests or activities are common

### For Casual Network
- Professional contacts and acquaintances
- Occasional check-ins are sufficient
- Still valuable connections worth maintaining

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to categorize everyone?

No! You can categorize as many or as few contacts as you want. The system works best when you've categorized at least 50% of your contacts, but you can always come back to finish later.

### What if someone doesn't fit neatly into a circle?

Go with your gut feeling about the relationship depth. If you're torn between two circles, consider:
- How often do you actually interact?
- Would you reach out to them with personal news?
- How much effort do you put into maintaining the relationship?

### Can I change circle assignments later?

Absolutely! Relationships evolve, and your circles should too. You can update assignments anytime from the Circles section.

### What if I exceed the recommended capacity?

The capacities are guidelines based on research, not hard limits. You'll see a gentle warning, but you can still add more people if that's right for your network. Just be aware that maintaining more relationships requires more time and energy.

### How does the AI make suggestions?

The AI analyzes:
- **Communication frequency**: How often you email, message, or interact
- **Recency**: When you last connected
- **Calendar patterns**: Shared meetings and events
- **Interaction quality**: Length and depth of communications

It uses this data to suggest which circle best fits each relationship.

### Is my data private?

Yes! All your contact data, circle assignments, and interaction history are:
- Stored securely in your private account
- Never shared with third parties
- Processed using secure OAuth flows
- Encrypted in transit and at rest

You can request data deletion at any time.

### What if I don't have Google Calendar or Contacts?

Currently, the onboarding flow is optimized for Google integrations. However, you can:
- Skip Step 1 and manually add contacts
- Use the Manage Circles flow without AI suggestions
- Still benefit from the circle organization system

Future updates will support additional calendar and contact providers.

### How long does onboarding take?

It depends on your network size:
- **Small network (< 50 contacts)**: 10-15 minutes
- **Medium network (50-150 contacts)**: 20-30 minutes
- **Large network (150+ contacts)**: 30-45 minutes

Remember, you can take breaks and resume anytime!
